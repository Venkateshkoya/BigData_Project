# BigData_Project

Project Title:
Stream Analytics
Project Idea:
This project aims to analyze server log data in real-time to identify patterns and anomalies. By ingesting
log data from various sources using Kafka, we will process and analyze this data with Apache Spark.
The goal is to detect unusual activities, such as spikes in error rates or unauthorized access attempts,
and visualize the results for easy interpretation.
