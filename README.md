# BigData_Project

Project Title: Stream Analytics

Project Idea: This project aims to analyze server log data in real-time to identify patterns and anomalies. By ingesting
log data from various sources using Kafka, we will process and analyze this data with Apache Spark.
The goal is to detect unusual activities, such as spikes in error rates or unauthorized access attempts,
and visualize the results for easy interpretation.

Developers:
Venkatesh Koya, Yechan Ryu, Sai Krishna Reddy Seelam, UdaykiranReddy Devarapally, Rajya Lakshmi Ganganaboina

Software Setup: Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Matplotlib

Goals Achieved:
1.Real-Time Data Processing
2.Sentiment Analysis Accuracy
3.Scalability and Resilience
4.Data Storage and Retrieval
5.Trend Analysis
6.Visualization and Insights
7.Integration with Big Data Frameworks
8.Impact of Data Quality
9.Cost and Efficiency
10.Ethical and Privacy Considerations

Conclusions:
Successfully implemented sentiment analysis using TextBlob in PySpark.
The results were visualized clearly using Matplotlib, providing insights into the sentiment
distribution.
Future steps include optimizing the pipeline for larger datasets and comparing results with
other libraries.
